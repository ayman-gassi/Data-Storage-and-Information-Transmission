# Digital Signing

## Description
This project implements **digital signing**, a cryptographic process used to verify the authenticity and integrity of digital messages or documents. Digital signing involves creating a unique signature using a private key, which can be verified by anyone with the corresponding public key. It ensures that the data has not been tampered with and confirms the identity of the sender, making it essential for secure communication, software distribution, and legal documentation.
