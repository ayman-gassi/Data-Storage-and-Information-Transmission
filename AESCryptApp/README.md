# AES Cryptography

## Description
This project implements the **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**, a symmetric encryption algorithm used to secure data. AES encrypts and decrypts data in fixed-size blocks (128 bits) using keys of 128, 192, or 256 bits. It is widely recognized for its strong security, efficiency, and versatility, making it a standard for protecting sensitive information in applications like file encryption, secure communications, and data storage.
