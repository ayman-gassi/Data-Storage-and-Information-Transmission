# RSA Cryptography

## Description
This project implements the **RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)** algorithm, an asymmetric encryption method widely used for secure data transmission. RSA relies on a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. It is based on the mathematical complexity of factoring large prime numbers, making it highly secure for applications like digital signatures, secure communication, and key exchange.
